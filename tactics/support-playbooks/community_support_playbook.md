# Community Support SLA Playbook

## Overview

Meeting your support service-level agreements (SLAs) doesn't have to be overwhelming, even when managing a large community across multiple channels. The key is having the right systems in place to catch every question, prioritize responses, and track your performance.

This playbook will help you build a sustainable support process that ensures no customer goes unanswered while keeping your team productive and focused on what matters most.

## What You'll Accomplish

By following this playbook, you'll create a system that automatically surfaces support requests, alerts your team to high-priority issues, and gives you clear visibility into your response performance. Most importantly, you'll deliver consistently excellent experiences that keep customers coming back.

## Step 1: Connect Your Community Channels

The foundation of great community support is knowing where your customers are asking questions. You can't respond to what you can't see, so start by mapping out all the places where support requests might appear.

Your customers likely reach out through multiple channels. They might ask questions in your Slack community, post issues on Reddit, or mention problems on social media. The goal is to create a centralized view of all this activity so nothing slips through the cracks.

**Action Steps:**
- List every channel where customers might ask questions (owned channels like your community forum, and external ones like Stack Overflow)
- Prioritize channels based on activity levels and customer value
- Set up monitoring or integrations to pull activity from each channel into a central dashboard
- Test that data is flowing correctly from each source

Start with your most active channels first. You'll get immediate value from better visibility, and you can add more channels as your system matures.

## Step 2: Create Smart Real-Time Alerts

Once your data is flowing, you need to make sure the right people see the right requests at the right time. This is where intelligent alerting comes in. Rather than drowning your team in notifications, you'll create targeted alerts that surface the most important activity.

Think about what kinds of requests need immediate attention versus what can wait. A billing issue from an enterprise customer should trigger an immediate alert, while a general product question might go into a daily digest.

**Configure Your Alert System:**

Create alerts for different scenarios based on urgency and customer type. For high-priority situations, set up alerts that trigger when enterprise customers or key accounts post questions, especially if they contain urgent keywords like "broken," "not working," or "bug."

For ongoing support, create alerts for product questions that help you stay on top of common issues and identify knowledge gaps in your documentation.

**Alert Configuration Process:**
- Name your alert with a clear, descriptive title
- Define what triggers it (channel, keywords, user type, activity category)  
- Set the conditions that must be met
- Choose how your team gets notified (Slack message, email, dashboard alert)

The key is balancing coverage with focus. You want to catch important issues without overwhelming your team with noise.

## Step 3: Track Unanswered Requests

Even with great alerts, some requests will fall through the cracks. Building a filtered view of unanswered activity ensures you catch everything that needs a response.

Create a dashboard view that shows all community activity that hasn't received a reply, filtered by age and priority. This becomes your team's daily checklist for making sure no one gets ignored.

**Build Your "No Reply" View:**

Start by filtering your activity feed to show only posts and messages that haven't received responses. Then layer on additional filters to help with prioritization. You might filter by customer type, showing enterprise accounts first, or by age, highlighting requests that are approaching your SLA deadline.

Use tagging to make prioritization even easier. Tag your most valuable community members as "VIP Customer" or "Enterprise Account" so their requests always surface at the top of your queue.

**Prioritization Framework:**

Not all unanswered requests are created equal. Establish clear priority levels with specific response time targets:

- **Critical (2-4 hours):** Enterprise customers, billing issues, service outages, security concerns
- **High (24 hours):** Product questions from qualified leads, integration problems, onboarding issues  
- **Medium (48-72 hours):** General product questions, feature requests from active users
- **Low (1 week):** General feedback, community discussions, social interactions

This framework helps your team focus on what matters most while ensuring everything eventually gets attention.

## Step 4: Measure Your Performance

You can't improve what you don't measure. Setting up proper metrics tracking helps you understand how well you're meeting your SLAs and where you need to improve.

The most important metrics fall into three categories: response rates, response times, and quality indicators. Response rate tells you what percentage of requests are getting answered. Response time shows how quickly you're getting back to people. Quality metrics help you understand if your responses are actually solving problems.

**Key Metrics to Track:**

Monitor your overall response rate and break it down by channel and priority level. This helps you identify if certain channels are being neglected or if high-priority requests are slipping through.

Track median response time rather than just averages, as this gives you a more realistic picture of typical performance. Also measure first response time separately from resolution time, since acknowledging receipt quickly can improve customer satisfaction even if full resolution takes longer.

**Create Your Dashboard:**

Build a daily dashboard that shows new unanswered posts from the last 24 hours, posts approaching SLA deadlines, and your team's response time performance. This gives you an at-a-glance view of what needs immediate attention.

Weekly and monthly reports should focus on trends and strategic insights. Look at how your response rates and times are changing over time, which channels are performing best, and where you might need additional resources or training.

## Step 5: Establish Response Workflows

Having great visibility is only valuable if your team knows what to do with it. Establish clear workflows that guide your team from initial request through resolution.

Your standard process should be: acknowledge receipt within your target timeframe, assess the complexity and required expertise, provide an initial response or escalate appropriately, follow up until resolution, and close the loop with customer confirmation.

**Escalation Guidelines:**

Some issues require immediate escalation regardless of normal priority rules. Customer threats to churn, security concerns, legal issues, or complaints from executive-level contacts should all trigger immediate escalation to senior team members.

For standard escalations, establish a clear process: tag the appropriate team member, provide context and urgency level, set expectations for response timing, monitor progress, and document the outcome for future reference.

## Step 6: Team Training and Continuous Improvement

Your system is only as good as the people using it. Ensure your team understands not just the tools and processes, but also your brand voice, escalation procedures, and customer personas.

Regular training should cover platform functionality, customer communication best practices, and updates to your products or services. But equally important is ongoing performance review and process refinement.

**Improvement Process:**

Conduct weekly reviews to analyze any missed SLA incidents and identify process improvement opportunities. Monthly assessments should look at whether your SLA targets are appropriate and if you need to adjust resource allocation.

Quarterly planning sessions are the time for bigger strategic questions: Are you monitoring the right channels? Do you need new tools? Should team responsibilities change as your community grows?

## Implementation Strategy

Don't try to implement everything at once. Start by connecting your most important channels and setting up basic alerts for high-priority scenarios. Once that's working smoothly, add more sophisticated filtering and additional channels.

Week 1-2 should focus on getting basic data flowing and testing that your alerts work correctly. Week 3-4 is for refining your filters and training your team on the new processes. By month 2, you should have a solid foundation that you can build on as your community grows.

## Success Indicators

You'll know your system is working when your response rates consistently meet targets, your team feels confident they're not missing important requests, and most importantly, your community members feel heard and supported.

Track customer satisfaction alongside your operational metrics. The goal isn't just to respond quickly, but to provide responses that actually help people succeed with your product. When you get that right, you'll see it reflected in community engagement, customer retention, and positive word-of-mouth growth.
