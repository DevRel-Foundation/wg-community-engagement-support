## Reporting a vulnerability

We take the security of community engagement practices and the protection of community member data seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our frameworks, templates, or implementation guidance, please follow these steps:

### For security issues in templates/frameworks

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Potential impact on community members
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### For implementation-specific security issues

If you encounter security issues while implementing these resources in your organization:

1. **Follow your organization's internal security procedures**
2. **Contact your organization's security team** for immediate guidance
3. **Consider reaching out to the working group** for best practice guidance (without sharing sensitive details)
