    Community Engagement & Support
</h1>

Welcome to the Developer Relations Foundation's Community Engagement & Support working group repository. This working group focuses on developing frameworks, strategies, and best practices for building thriving developer communities through meaningful engagement, comprehensive support systems, and sustainable community growth.

## Our mission

To establish standardized approaches and resources that enable organizations to build, nurture, and scale developer communities that drive mutual value for both developers and organizations through authentic engagement and robust support ecosystems.

## Working group objectives

- Create reusable templates and frameworks for community engagement and support strategies
- Establish industry standards for community engagement across different organizational contexts
- Develop tools and templates that can be immediately implemented by DevRel professionals
- Foster collaboration and learning within the broader DevRel community

## Repo structure
All directories listed are intended to serve as a set of resource you may utilize when building a new Developer Community program, or evolving an existing one. Read through each and use them as appropriate and necessary for your organization or vertical. Not all may be required to fulfill your goals right away. Keep this project bookmarked as a resource for the future.
