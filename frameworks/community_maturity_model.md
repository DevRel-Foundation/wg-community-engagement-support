    Community Maturity Models
</h1>


## Overview

Community Maturity Models are frameworks that help organizations understand, assess, and improve their community programs over time. They provide structured approaches to evaluate where your community currently stands and identify the next steps in your community development journey. This guide presents the most commonly used and well-established Community Maturity Models to help you choose the right framework for your organization.

## Why Use a Community Maturity Model?

Community Maturity Models serve several critical functions:

- **Benchmarking**: Assess your current community program's effectiveness and maturity level
- **Strategic Planning**: Create roadmaps for community development and resource allocation
- **Standardization**: Establish common language and expectations across your organization
- **Measurement**: Track progress and demonstrate ROI to stakeholders
- **Innovation Framework**: Provide structure within which to experiment and improve
- **Resource Optimization**: Identify where to focus efforts for maximum impact

## Suggested Community Maturity Models

### The Community Roundtable's Community Maturity Model™ (CMM)

**Developer**: [The Community Roundtable (2009, updated 2019)](https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/)
**License**: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International
**Attribution Required**: "Community Maturity Model™ by The Community Roundtable is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. Based on a work at https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/"

**Overview**: The most widely referenced and adopted framework in the industry. This model helps organizations understand, plan for, and assess the performance of online community initiatives.

#### Four maturity stages

**Stage 1 (CMM1) - Emergent**
- Organizations range from those relatively untouched by social technologies to those with chaotic, inconsistent approaches
- Some usage and experimentation with social tools and techniques (formal or informal)
- Limited coordination between different teams and technologies

**Stage 2 (CMM2) - Established** 
- Organizations focus on organizing, assessing opportunity, research, and marshaling resources
- Development of operational approaches and resource allocation
- Defined budgets, community management resources, and policies
- Increased investment in infrastructure, tools, and teams

**Stage 3 (CMM3) - Maturing**
- Organizations see meaningful business returns at scale
- Focus shifts to sustaining and managing growth
- Decision point: discrete business goals vs. broader business strategy integration
- Risk of de-prioritizing community management due to member self-management

**Stage 4 (CMM4) - Networked**
- Major philosophical, cultural, and structural organizational changes
- Networked approach integrating employee, customer, partner constituencies
- Default mode of sharing and openness rather than proprietary approaches
- All management resembles community management with coaching and facilitation

#### Eight core competencies:
The model defines eight competencies required for successful community management (specific competencies available through The Community Roundtable's detailed resources).

**Best for**: Organizations seeking a comprehensive, industry-standard framework with extensive supporting resources and benchmarking capabilities.

**Access**: Free assessment tool available; detailed resources require subscription.

## Implementation recommendations

### Getting started

1. **Assessment**
   - Choose the model that best fits your community type and organizational context
   - Conduct initial maturity assessment using your selected framework
   - Document current state across all model dimensions

2. **Planning**
   - Identify gaps between current and desired maturity levels
   - Prioritize areas for improvement based on organizational goals
   - Develop action plans with specific, measurable objectives

3. **Implementation**
   - Execute improvement initiatives systematically
   - Monitor progress using model metrics
   - Adjust strategies based on results and feedback

4. **Evolve**
   - Regularly reassess maturity levels (quarterly or bi-annually)
   - Update strategies based on organizational changes
   - Share learnings with broader community management networks

### Best practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic assessment before diving deep into complex frameworks
- **Involve stakeholders**: Include community members, leadership, and cross-functional teams in assessment
- **Focus on action**: Use assessment results to drive specific improvements, not just measurement
- **Regular review**: Maturity models are most valuable when used consistently over time
- **Adapt as needed**: Modify frameworks to fit your specific organizational context and needs

## Modern trends in Community Maturity Assessment

### Multi-dimensional frameworks
Organizations increasingly use multiple maturity models together to assess various capabilities simultaneously, rather than relying on single models in isolation. This approach provides more comprehensive insights across different aspects of community management.

### Integration with business strategy
Modern applications of maturity models emphasize integration with broader business strategy rather than treating community as an isolated function.

### Continuous assessment
Organizations are moving toward continuous assessment approaches rather than annual or periodic evaluations, using real-time metrics and feedback loops.
