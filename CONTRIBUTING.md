# Contributing to the Community Engagement & Support working group

The Community Engagement & Support working group develops frameworks, templates, and best practices that enable organizations to build thriving developer communities. Our work focuses on creating reusable resources that can be immediately implemented by DevRel professionals across different industries and organizational contexts.

### Our approach
- Everything we create should solve real problems for DevRel practitioners
- We welcome contributors from all backgrounds and experience levels
- Our resources are freely available and adaptable to different contexts
- Recommendations included in the repo are grounded in data and real-world experience
- We embrace feedback and iteration to improve our work
