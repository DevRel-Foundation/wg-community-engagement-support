# Developer Relations Foundation (DRF) Birds of a Feather (BoF) Framework for Conferences

This framework is designed to support interactive, community-led discussions at conferences about DRF.
The goal is to facilitate peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and encourage broader participation in the DevRel Foundation’s working groups.
The framework is an adaptation of a format from the [TODO Group OSPOlogy BoFs](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/BoF), customized for the DRF audience.

## Title and Description

- Format: Birds of a Feather + Roundtables

- Title: DevRel Foundation Ask Me Anything Session

- Abstract: The DevRel Foundation is a vendor-neutral initiative aimed at building shared understanding, resources, and best practices to elevate the professional practices of developer relations across industries. In response to recent challenges, including industry layoffs and the evolving landscape of DevRel roles, the foundation has established working groups to tackle pressing issues such as metrics and reporting, career support, and resource aggregation. This session offers attendees the opportunity to connect with thought leaders in the DevRel Foundation community, engage in discussions about current challenges, and explore ways to get involved in shaping the future of the developer relation foundation. Key questions to explore include: What strategies can showcase the return on investment of DevRel initiatives to stakeholders? What skills are becoming important in the evolving DevRel landscape, and how can professionals acquire them? How can engaging with the DevRel Foundation’s working groups enhance your career?

The final output will result in a report capturing the roundtable's insights and recommendations authored by the attendees, hosted under Developer Relations' Foundation GH organization under CC-BY 4.0
